# Game of Life

This is a Ruby implementation of Conway's Game of Life. To operate, download the repository and run the command `ruby game.rb` in the root directory. To change starting params, edit the script at the end game.rb. If no argument is passed for starting locations, the game displays a cursor and allow you to manually select starting cells.
